# matrixtable
Javascript to build a DOM object consisting of an html table accessible as an NxM matrix

I developed matrixtable in 2007 for use with several "single page applications"... back then we just called it ajax.

The code is fully documented.  For production use I'd suggest the minified version.

See the html file for an example of usage.
